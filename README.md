# Custom-RockPi-setup


With this simple setup it is possible to customize a new installation of DietPi on the RockPi4 like I always do. It is possible to do single parts of this installation on other boards. 

What is possible so far:
Wireguard installation on a RockPi with DietPi


















A script, used to install the kernelheaders for the RockPi4, dependencies and, of course, Wireguard.

**Usage:**

```
sudo curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twerpyfie/RP4-Wireguard-installer/master/rp4-wg-installer
chmod +x rp4-wg-installer
bash ./rp4-wg-installer
```
